/*
Brine data, by Ian Bell, 2012

Coefficients taken from 

Ake Melinder, "Properties of Secondary Working Fluids for Indirect Systems", 2010.  Published by IIR.

Erratum: 
	--> In the tables of coefficients, the range for y should always be between tF(x) < y < ymax
	--> There is a typo in the specific heat for Ethylene Glycol, coefficients give a result in kJ/kg
	--> Watch out for some values with commas that should be decimals
